âœ… PowerPlay Backend Debug Report

---

## Current Backend File: main.py

### âœ… Confirmed:
- `/detect-football/` route **exists** and is defined properly.
- **CORS middleware** is correctly set with `allow_origins=["*"]`.
- Uploads are safely validated for:
  - Missing file
  - Empty file content
- Detection model (`YOLO`) is loaded at startup.
- Touch logic and tracking state are functional.
- Routes also exist for:
  - `POST /reset-touches/`
  - `GET /touches/`

---

## ðŸš¨ Live Issues Reported

### 1. **404 on /detect-football/**
**Error:**
POST https://powerplay-api.onrender.com/detect-football/ - 404 Not Found

**Causes:**
- Incorrect file may be deployed to Render.
- Dependencies may not be installed (causing silent failure).
- App may not have restarted properly after changes.

### 2. **CORS Block**
**Error:**
Access blocked by CORS: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header

**Notes:**
- CORS settings are correct **in code**.
- Likely backend isn't starting correctly, so CORS headers never reach client.

## ðŸ”§ Deployment Fix Checklist

1. âœ… Rebuild & re-deploy Render backend with this exact `main.py`.
2. âœ… Ensure `requirements.txt` includes:
   - fastapi
   - uvicorn
   - numpy
   - opencv-python
   - ultralytics
3. âœ… Check Render logs for:
   - Import errors
   - YOLO model loading issues
   - Route registration failures

---

## âœ… Optional Improvement

Wrap `/detect-football/` in `try/except` to surface backend errors in response:
```python
@app.post("/detect-football/")
async def detect_football(file: UploadFile = File(...)):
    try:
        ...
    except Exception as e:
        return {"error": str(e)}
